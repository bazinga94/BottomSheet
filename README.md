## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

* <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>:

```ruby
pod 'JHBottomSheet', '~> 1.0.1'
```

* <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/" target="_blank">Swift Package Manager</a>:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/bazinga94/BottomSheet.git", .exact("1.0.1")),
],
```

## Usage

Include the UIViewController to be presented in the BottomSheet initializer. After that, you can use it like presenting and dismissing UIViewController.

```swift
let bottomSheet = BottomSheet.init(childViewController: yourViewController, height: 500)
present(bottomSheet, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

If you adopt the BottomSheetFlexible protocol and want to present the bottom sheet as much as the size of the view, you don't need to include the height.

```swift
public protocol BottomSheetFlexible: AnyObject {
	var bottomSheetContentView: UIView! { get set }
}
```
